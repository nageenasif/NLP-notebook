The information need not be exhaustive, and we might want to add further properties. For example, in the case of a verb, it is often useful to know what \"semantic role\" is played by the arguments of the verb. In the case of chase, the subject plays the role of \"agent\", while the object has the role of \"patient\". Let's add this information, using 'sbj' and 'obj' as placeholders which will get filled once the verb combines with its grammatical arguments:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"fb-4LXZgYL_F","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["chase['AGT'] = 'sbj'\n","chase['PAT'] = 'obj'"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"417E0BvPYPyJ","colab_type":"text"},"source":["If we now process a sentence Kim chased Lee, we want to \"bind\" the verb's agent role to the subject and the patient role to the object.

Our next task in this chapter is to show how the framework of context free grammar and parsing can be expanded to accommodate feature structures, so that we can build analyses like this in a more generic and principled way. We will start off by looking at the phenomenon of syntactic agreement; we will show how agreement constraints can be expressed elegantly using features, and illustrate their use in a simple grammar.\n","\n","Since feature structures are a general data structure for representing information of any kind, we will briefly look at them from a more formal point of view, and illustrate the support for feature structures offered by NLTK.
